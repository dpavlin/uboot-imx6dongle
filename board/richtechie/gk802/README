U-Boot for GK802 based on Freescale i.MX6

This file contains information for the port of U-Boot to the GK802 HDMI
dongle, designed by Richtechie.


USB HARDWARE
------------

The GK802 has a USB A (host) port, and a micro B (device) port. These are
wired together, such that only one can be used at a time. In order to use the
host mode, it is necessary to ensure that the power supply does not connect to
the USB D+/D- lines of the micro B port.
Similarly, if booting the device via USB, nothing must be connected to the
A port's data lines.

BOOTING OPTIONS
---------------

U-Boot can be loaded over USB (see README.imxboot), or from the internal
microSD card (see README.imximage).


BOOT SCRIPTS
------------

If the recessed button on the device is held during boot, the 'recovery'
environment variable will be equal to 1.

The default bootcmd looks for a u-boot script named '/boot/boot.scr', and
failing that, for a uImage-format kernel named '/boot/uImage'. This search is
performed, in order, on the first partitions of:

1. external SD
2. internal SD
3. USB storage devices

An example boot script would be:

    setenv bootargs console=${console},115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rootwait
    load ${loaddev} ${loadaddr} /boot/uImage
    bootm
